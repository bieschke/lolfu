Smattering of Python programs and utilities written around Riot's League of Legends API.

Dependencies:
<li>Python 3.4.3 - https://www.python.org</li>
<li>Requests 2.7.0 - http://requests.readthedocs.org</li>
<li>CherryPy 3.8.0 - http://www.cherrypy.org</li>
<li>Mako 1.0.1 - http://www.makotemplates.org</li>

<code>site.py</code> is a CherryPy application that allows one to lookup summoners and see
what is the winrate optimal champions they should be playing in each role.

<code>riot.py</code> is a simple wrapper around Riot's LOL API. You can either pass your 
api key directly to it's constructor, or create a <code>riot.cfg</code> file that it'll 
read from upon instantiation. This wrapper is resilient to temporary downtime on Riot's 
server, using a progressively delayed retry mechanism when encountering these types of 
server failures. When surpassing Riot API rate limits, the wrapper will automatically 
respect the Retry-After header and resume querying after the rate limit threshold has 
passed.

<code>scripts/match_simple.py</code> walks a starting set of summoners, retrieves
complete match history for each of those summoners, and then continues to spider the 
observed summoners from those matches, outputting ARFF data to stdout for all of the
retrieved matches. This program also accepts optional command line arguments, where
each argument is a previously collected ARFF file. Supplying the previously created 
data files allows this program to skip existing matches and only output data for
previously unobserved matches.

<code>scripts/arff_reader.py</code> is a command line utility that reads in ARFF via stdin
and writes either CSV or JSON-ified dictionaries to stdout. Keys in the JSON output are 
the ARFF attribute names and values are the ARFF data. Useful for piping ARFF files.
