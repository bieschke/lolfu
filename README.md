<code>site.py</code> is a CherryPy application that allows one to lookup summoners and see
what is the winrate optimal champions they should be playing in each role.

<code>riot.py</code> is a simple wrapper around Riot's LOL API. This wrapper is resilient
to temporary downtime on Riot's server, using a progressively delayed retry mechanism when 
encountering these types of server failures. When surpassing Riot API rate limits, the 
wrapper will automatically respect the Retry-After header and resume querying after the 
rate limit threshold has passed.
