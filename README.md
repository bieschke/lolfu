lolfu
=====
Smattering of Python programs and utilities written around Riot's League of Legends API.

The <code>riot.py</code> module is a simple wrapper around Riot's LOL API. You can
either pass your api key directly to it's constructor, or create a <code>riot.cfg</code>
file that it'll read from upon instantiation. This wrapper is resilient to temporary
downtime on Riot's server, using a progressively delayed retry mechanism when
encountering these types of server failures.

The <code>match_simple_collector.py</code> program walks a starting set of summoners,
retrieves complete match history for each of those summoners, and then continues to spider
the observed summoners from those matches, outputting ARFF data to stdout for all of
the retrieved matches.

The <code>match_complex_converter.py</code> program converts a simple match ARFF file
into a complex match ARFF file by layering in summoner and summoner-champion statistics
in addition to the bare bones statistics provided in a simple match.

The <code>match_predictor.py</code> utility is a simple command line program that
predicts the likelihood of winning the described match.
