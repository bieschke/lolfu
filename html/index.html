    <h3>How does this work?</h3>

    <p class="lead">Most summoners are unaware of which champions in their champion pool are actually strongest. Lolfu computes the winrate for all champions you've played in all positions and informs you about which champions in your pool you should lean on to climb the solo queue ladder.

    <p class="lead">Playing your highest winrate champions in each position greatly increases the likelihood of you climbing.</p>

    <h3>What data is this based on?</h3>

    <p class="lead">Lolfu is built on top of the <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com">Riot Games API</a> and is constantly pulling additional data. Currently lolfu has collected data from ${match_count} matches and ${summoner_count} summoners and growing.</p>
