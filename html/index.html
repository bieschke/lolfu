<h3>How does this work!?</h3>

<p class="lead">Lolfu uses science. We model champion selection as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">multi-armed bandit</a> problem where each champion is an arm. We then recommend champions using an epsilon-greedy strategy setting epsilon equal to zero.</p>

<p class="lead">Why epsilon zero? Because there are too many champions and not enough time within a single season to spend too much time exploring your champion pool. With 100+ champions playing 10 games on each champion would be &gt;1000 games!</p>
